    <p>
      Heyy, here we go—welcome to the fourth year, babe. <br><br>
      But wait... the fourth year? When? Can we make it? Can we do a fourth year?<br><br>
      I can't just be your friend, Aya. I promised you that I'd leave if we weren't something more than friends. I love you so much. Kanbghik bzeef. But I can't be your friend only.<br><br>
      I wish I could be your partner now, and your partner forever. <br>
      That's why after our last date—if a miracle happens—if we become boyfriend and girlfriend... just forget everything I'm saying now 😅<br><br>
      But if not, I want you to know that I'm sorry for giving up and leaving. 💖
